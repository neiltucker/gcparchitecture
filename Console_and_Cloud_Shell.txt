### Working with the Console and Cloud Shell
### These exercises should be done only in QWIK Labs

Perform the following actions using both the Cloud Shell and Cloud Console:

1.  Create a bucket

2.  Upload a text or html file to the bucket

3.  Make the bucket publicly accessible (over the Internet)

4.  Verify that you can access the file using a URL

5.  Remove public access to the file

6.  Verify that it is no longer accessible over the Internet

7.  Modify the .profile file in Cloud Shell so you always load an environment variable named PROJECT_ID with the name of your project
