Perform the first steps using the Google Cloud Console:

1.  Create a Multi-Regional Bucket and upload two text files to it

2.  Rename one file to file1.txt and the second to file2.txt

3.  Create a folder named txt

4.  Move the files to the csv folder

5.  Rename both files so they have csv extensions

6.  Try to change the bucket to be Regional instead of Multi-Regional

7.  Why did the previous step fail?

8.  Create a Regional Bucket 

9.  Move the files from the Multi-Regional to the Regional Bucket
