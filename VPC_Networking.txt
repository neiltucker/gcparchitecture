### VPC Networking
### These exercises should be done only in QWIK Labs

Networking Project:

1.  Delete all existing VPC Networks

2.  Create two VPC Networks (Custom or Auto mode)

3.  Create two instances in each network using only internal IPs

4.  Verify that each instance is only able to communicate with the other instance in its own VPC

5.  Without assigning external IPs, configure all four instances with access to the Internet

6.  Verify Internet connectivity for each instance
